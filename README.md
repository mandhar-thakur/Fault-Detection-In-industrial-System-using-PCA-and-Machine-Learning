# Fault-Detection-In-industrial-System-using-PCA-and-Machine-Learning
An innovative fault detection system for banking systems using PCA and machine learning to enhance accuracy, reduce false positives, enable early fault detection, and enhance system reliability.

In the ever-evolving financial landscape, banking systems play a crucial role in facilitating transactions and managing customer finances. However, the complexity and scale of these systems introduce potential vulnerabilities that can lead to faults and disruptions. To ensure the integrity and reliability of banking operations, fault detection mechanisms are essential.

Problem Statement

Traditional fault detection methods often rely on manual observation and rule-based systems, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Moreover, these methods may not effectively capture the subtle patterns and anomalies that indicate impending faults.

Proposed Solution

This project proposes a novel approach to fault detection in banking systems using a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and machine learning techniques. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps identify the most important features from a large dataset. Machine learning algorithms can then be trained on these features to classify system states as either normal or faulty.

Methodology

Data Collection: Gather historical banking system data, including transaction records, system logs, and performance metrics.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis, handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.

Feature Extraction: Apply PCA to extract the most significant features from the preprocessed data.

Model Training: Train machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Random Forest, on the extracted features.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

Fault Detection: Deploy the trained models in real-time to monitor the banking system and detect potential faults.
